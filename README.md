# Maria's 30th Birthday

To celebrate my wife’s 30th birthday, I created a special project that combines her love for literature and adventure. Inspired by the beautiful novel "O Conto da Ilha Desconhecida (The Tale of the Unknown Island)" by José Saramago, I designed and developed a custom game using React Three Fiber.

In this interactive 3D experience, my wife is the main character on a quest to find her birthday gift. Throughout the game, she follows clues and collects items, each one bringing her closer to discovering the ultimate surprise.
